  * when you build technology with the community that is going to use it
  * when the technology is open sourced
  * when the decisions on what technology is used are made by their users
  * when the technology infrastructure is owned and controlled by the community that uses it
  * when the education around technology happens in a horizontal space where the knowledge is shared
