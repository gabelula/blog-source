# Languages

- [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html): as Tor is starting to use it I'm curious to know a little more about it.
- [Exercism Rust Track](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/rust): exercism rocks!

# Framework for fron-end applications

- [choo.js : very cute: choo choo!](https://github.com/choojs/choo)

# SQL queries on CSV/TSV files

- [q](https://github.com/harelba/q), although why oh why people name things with only one letter and fuck up search on them.

# Graph databases

- [dgraph](https://dgraph.io/).
