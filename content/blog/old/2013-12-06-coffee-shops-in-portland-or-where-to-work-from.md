I love coffee shops that feel like my grandma&#8217;s living room. The ones that have very old furniture and where people share tables. The one near my house (that does not look like my grandma&#8217;s living room) that serves very good coffee is always so full of people in the mornings. Coffee shops are the social/community place for people that don&#8217;t go to churches in the US&#8230;
